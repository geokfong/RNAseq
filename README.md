# RNAseq
This repository contains scripts related to RNASeq that I developed in the IMCB, A*STAR.
## Installation
I used mostly conda to set up my envioroments, such as 
`mamba create -n RNASeq -c bioconda fastqc star sra-tools trimmomatic samtools bedtools`

I'll update as I modify or write new scripts.
